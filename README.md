# Storyworlds
Create and collaborate on interactive fiction. Anyone can continue the story.

## Web application
Coming soon.

## Standalone application
The standalone command-line version of Storyworlds does not allow collaboration but allows creation and editing of storyworlds in a classic text-based console game feel. It can be installed using maven by running `mvn clean package install`.

To start the application, run `java -jar storyworlds-0.0.1.jar`.

Requirements: Java, Maven installed and added to PATH.
